    "\n",
    "Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, 155349.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly 99%."

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of checking if every number is or is not a bouncy number, we can find all non-bouncy number in a recursive way. In fact, if a number is non-bouncy increasing, we can add another digit that is greater or equals to the last added digit while still having a non-bouncy increasing number (e.g. 73 -> 773, 873, 973). Same thing applies to decreasing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we set all non-bouncy number in a cache, we can compute the cumsum and find the first index for which the ratio of bouncy number is higher than 0.99"
