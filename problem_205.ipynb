    "The number of possible conigurations is $4^9 \\times 6^6$, which is incredibly high. However, it is possible to consider them separately and compute all the possible sums that the two players can obtain. After doing that, the total number of victories for player A are obtained by multiplying the number of sums of a certain value for the number of sums of player B that have a total less than the considered value:\n",
