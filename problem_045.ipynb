    "The proposed solution is very fast and iterates over the hexagonal numbers (because we need less of them -> less comparisons); at each iteration we try to increment the corresponding pentagonal and triangular numbers, untile they are greater or equals to the current hexagonal numbers. A solution is found when all the three numbers are the same.\n",
