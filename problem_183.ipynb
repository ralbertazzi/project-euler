    "Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into k equal parts, r = N/k, so that N = r + r + ... + r.\n",
    "Let P be the product of these parts, P = r × r × ... × r = rk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.2^5 = 51.53632.\n",

    "Let M(N) = Pmax for a given value of N.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into four equal parts which leads to Pmax = (11/4)^4; that is, M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.\n",

We can then find the factors of all Ks and if *n* is not a multiple of the non-2 and non-5 factors of k then we have a non-terminating fraction. This solution is extremely fast"
